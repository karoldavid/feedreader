#### Here is a link to the live version
http://karoldavid.github.io/feedreader

## Project Overview

"test-driven development" is an important part of the development process. It ensures that features, to be developed in the future, do not break existing features. In this project, a number of tests are run against a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The test suites are written within Jasmina, a JavaScript Testing Framework. They test the underlying business logic of the application, the event handling and the DOM manipulation.

### The spec file 'jasmine/spec/feeadreader.js' contains 5 test suites

#### Three obligatory test suites
* RSS Feeds
* The Menu
* Initial Entries

#### Two additional test suites
* New Feed Selection
* Selected Feed Entry
